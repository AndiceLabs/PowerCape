The BeagleBone PowerCape is a power supply cape that combines a TI buck/boost regulator with a Li-Ion/Li-Poly charging circuit.  It converts a 3V to 14V DC source or 3.7V battery source into 5V for the BeagleBone.  It also sports a TI INA219 power monitor that allows for monitoring of the battery voltage and current.

Power to the BeagleBone is controlled by an AVR "supervisor" allowing the BeagleBone to be completely turned off and turned back on due to an external event or an elapsed time.  The regulator and AVR continue to run but consume less than 70uA while running from a 3.7V battery source.  Quiescent current increases to 1.2mA when using the DC power input.
